Once imagined as a space of liberation, the internet today is a rabble of oppressive corporations and governments. Much of its empowering potential has faded, or been trampled by hate mobs. But perhaps there is a way forward.

What if you had your own personal server, and then you wouldn't need to deal with the corporate monopolies? Or you could run a small server and help other people too. They could be family, people on your street, a club you're in or a software project.

LibreServer is a small server system which enables you to run your own internet services independently. It includes all of the things you'd expect such as email, chat, VoIP, wikis, blogs, social networks, and more. You can run LibreServer on an old laptop or single board computer. You can also run it on an onion address.

Reclaim the internet, one server at a time.
