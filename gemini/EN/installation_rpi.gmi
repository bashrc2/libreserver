=> installation.gmi ► How to install on an x86 system

## ⃟ Step 1: Download

  wget https://raspi.debian.net/daily/raspi_4_bookworm.img.xz
  wget https://raspi.debian.net/daily/raspi_4_bookworm.img.xz.sha256

Verify the download:

  sha256sum -c raspi_4_bookworm.img.xz.sha256

## ⃟ Step 2: Copy to drive

Copy the image to your drive. This could be microSD, a USB stick or an SSD.

  xzcat raspi_4_bookworm.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=64k oflag=dsync status=progress
  sync

Where sdX is the name of your drive.

## ⃟ Step 3: Prepare the Debian image

You will need to prepare the image for remote login. Eject the drive then reconnect it and mount RASPIROOT. You will need to have set up an ssh key. To view your public key:

  cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Move to the root partition:

  sudo su
  cd /media/yourusername/RASPIROOT/

And create an empty ssh file.

  touch boot/ssh

Allow remote root login, but not via a password.

  sed -i 's|#PermitRootLogin|PermitRootLogin|g' etc/ssh/sshd_config
  sed -i 's|PermitRootLogin.*|PermitRootLogin yes|g' etc/ssh/sshd_config
  sed -i 's|#PasswordAuthentication|PasswordAuthentication|g' etc/ssh/sshd_config
  sed -i 's|PasswordAuthentication.*|PasswordAuthentication no|g' etc/ssh/sshd_config
  echo "your ssh public key" > root/.ssh/authorized_keys
  sync
  exit

Now eject the drive.

## ⃟ Step 4: Plug in

Connect everything up to your Raspberry Pi.

 * Ethernet cable between your internet router and the Raspberry Pi.
 * Plug the drive into the Raspberry Pi.
 * Connect a power supply to the Raspberry Pi.

If the Pi fails to boot then go back to step 2 and try writing to the drive again, or using a different drive. Sometimes copying the image to the drive is not always entirely reliable.

## ⃟ Step 5: Locate on the network

Find you server's local IP address. It will usually start with 192.168.. A typical way to do this is to log in to your internet router and show the list of devices on your local network.

## ⃟ Step 6: Log in

Log into the Pi using ssh.

  ssh root@192.168.x.y

You will not need a password because ssh public key authentication is used instead.

## ⃟ Step 7: Clone the LibreServer repo

Update the system:

  apt update
  apt upgrade

Then clone the LibreServer repository and checkout the bookworm development branch.

  apt install -y git dialog build-essential
  cd
  git clone https://gitlab.com/bashrc2/libreserver
  cd libreserver
  git checkout bookworm

Install the LibreServer commands:

  make install

Create an admin user:

  adduser admin

Their name could just be "admin" and the other details, including the password, are unimportant. Whatever you set the password to it will be changed during the install process.

## ⃟ Step 8: Start the install

To begin installing the clearnet version:

  libreserver menuconfig

or for the onion version:

  libreserver menuconfig-onion

You will be prompted to select a language and then be given a new password. Write this down or store it in a password manager.

If you are not installing the onion version then you will be also be asked for dynamic DNS and domain name. The domain name must be one which you own, and not a free-as-in-gratis subdomain.

Installation may take a long time - possibly up to a few hours - depending on your type of drive and internet bandwidth, but you can leave it running unattended. microSD cards and USB sticks are typically quite slow (unless it's USB3 and your hardware has USB3 sockets).

## ⃟ Step 9: Browse to admin

When installation is complete you can log into your server with a browser.

  http://192.168.x.y/admin

The username is admin and the password is the one you wrote down or added to your password manager.
