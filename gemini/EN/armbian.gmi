=> https://www.armbian.com/download Download the Armbian image for your board.

It must be version 11 (Bullseye), otherwise it won't work. Extract the image from its archive, then copy it to a microSD card

``` command
sudo dd bs=32M if=[Armbian .img file] of=/dev/sdX conv=fdatasync,sync,noerror status=progress
```

Where /dev/sdX is the path for the microSD drive on your system.

When that's done use a tool such as Gparted to resize the partition on the microSD card to fill up any remaining available space.

Insert the microSD drive into your ARM board, connect it to your internet router with an ethernet cable and plug in the power.

The board should then show up somewhere on your local network. You can log into your internet router to see what devices are connected and obtain the local IP address for the board that way, or use a network scanning tool.

Once you know the local IP address of your ARM board then you can log into it with:

``` command
ssh root@[local IP address]
```

Using the default Armbian password of 1234. You should see the Armbian welcome message and will be asked to change the password, then create a new user account.

When the user account is created type 'exit' to leave the ssh session then log back in with your new user account.

``` command
ssh myusername@[local IP address]
```

Become the root user:

``` command
sudo su
```

Update the system:

``` command
apt update
apt upgrade
```

Then clone the LibreServer repository and checkout the bookworm development branch.

``` command
apt install -y git dialog build-essential
git clone https://gitlab.com/bashrc2/libreserver
cd libreserver
git checkout bookworm
```

Install the LibreServer commands:

``` command
make install
```

Create an admin user:

``` command
adduser admin
```

Their name could just be "admin" and the other details are unimportant.

And now you can begin installing the LibreServer system. There are two ways of doing this. If you already own a domain name which you want to use then run:

``` command
libreserver menuconfig
```

Alternatively, if you don't own a domain name, don't have administrator access to your internet router or if you want to be able to access your sites only via onion addresses then run:

``` command
libreserver menuconfig-onion
```

You will then be taken through a few questions and the system will install.

Afterwards you'll be able to log into your system via the web interface at http://[local IP address]/admin.
