#RHEL-06-000281:The system package management tool must verify contents of all files associated with the audit package.
#For auditd package, to do what we wanna do in Debian there's something different, if you wanna get the packages default permission or owner(group-owner), or the packages'contents. You should use the "aptitude download <package-name>" to download it and use "dpkg -c <package.deb>" to read.
#There's one file is very special,if you issue the command "dpkg -c audit*.deb" you will found the audit rules file is "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules", but when you extract the deb package and read the "DEBIAN/postinst" you will find the auditd package copy the "/etc/audit/audit.d/audit.rules" file to "/etc/audit/audit.rules", so we could'n only use the "dpkg -c audit*.deb | awk '{print $6}' | sed -e 's/^.//g'" to get "ALL" the files we want to check.We should manually add the "/etc/audit/audit.rules" to check
#And the directory we check also have one thing special, the "/usr/share/man", in Debian that directory have permission 0775 by default. but the package show the 0755, so I decided to check without this directory.
#I use the sha512sum to do the files' content checking
