	Friendica is a federated social networking system. It can federate with other popular systems such as Mastodon and Diaspora. Currently Friendica only works on the clearnet and doesn't have an onion address.
      </p>

      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <p>
	Log into your system with:
      </p>

      <pre>ssh myusername@mydomain -p 2222</pre>

      <p>
	Using cursor keys and Enter key select <b>Administrator controls</b> and type in your password.
      </p>

      <p>
	Select <b>Add/Remove Apps</b> then <b>friendica</b>. You will then be asked for a domain name and if you are using FreeDNS also the code for the domain which can be found under <b>Dynamic DNS</b> on the FreeDNS site (the random string from "<i>quick cron example</i>" which appears after <i>update.php?</i> and before <i>&gt;&gt;</i>). For more details on obtaining a domain and making it accessible via dynamic DNS see the <a href="./faq.html">FAQ</a>. Typically the domain name you use will be a subdomain, such as <i>friendica.mydomainname.net</i>. It will need to be a domain which you have bought somewhere and own and not one of the FreeDNS subdomains, otherwise you won't be able to get a SSL/TLS certificate for it.
      </p>

      <p>
	After the install has completed go to <b>Security settings</b> and select <b>Create a new Let's Encrypt certificate</b> and enter the domain name that you are using for Friendica. If the certificate is obtained successfully then you will see a congratulations message.
      </p>


      <h2>Initial setup</h2>
      <p>
	If you have just obtained a Lets Encrypt certificate as above then go to <b>About</b> on the administrator control panel and you should see your Friendica domain listed there. You can then navigate to your site in a browser.
      </p>

      <p>
	On first visiting your Friendica site you'll see the login screen. The first thing you need to do is to select <b>register</b> to create a new Friendica administrator user. The first user on the system then becomes its administrator.
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>
	Friendica has numerous addons which you might want to explore. Select the small icon next to the search box and you will get to the administrator settings. Select <b>plugins</b> and you can then configure which ones you want. From the <b>site</b> settings you can also force all links to use SSL/TLS for added security.
      </p>

      <p>
	You can have as many users register as you wish, but it's a good idea to close registrations once you don't need any more accounts in order to prevent millions of random users from the internet setting up home on your Friendica site and ruining the performance of your server. To do that go to the <b>Administrator control panel</b> and select <b>App Settings</b> then <b>friendica</b>. You can then choose the option to prevent new account registrations.
