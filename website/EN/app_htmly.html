	HTMLy is a databaseless blogging system.
      </p>

      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <p>
	Log into your system with:
      </p>

      <pre>ssh myusername@mydomain -p 2222</pre>

      <p>
	Using cursor keys and Enter key select <b>Administrator controls</b> and type in your password.
      </p>

      <p>
	Select <b>Add/Remove Apps</b> then <b>htmly</b>. You will then be asked for a domain name and if you are using FreeDNS also the code for the domain which can be found under <b>Dynamic DNS</b> on the FreeDNS site (the random string from "<i>quick cron example</i>" which appears after <i>update.php?</i> and before <i>&gt;&gt;</i>). For more details on obtaining a domain and making it accessible via dynamic DNS see the <a href="./faq.html">FAQ</a>. Typically the domain name you use will be a subdomain, such as <i>blog.mydomainname.net</i>. It will need to be a domain which you have bought somewhere and own and not one of the FreeDNS subdomains, otherwise you won't be able to get a SSL/TLS certificate for it.
      </p>

      <p>
	After the install has completed go to <b>Security settings</b> and select <b>Create a new Let's Encrypt certificate</b> and enter the domain name that you are using for HTMLy. If you're using the "onion only" version of the system then you don't need to do this. If the certificate is obtained successfully then you will see a congratulations message.
      </p>

      <h2>Initial setup</h2>
      <p>
	If you have just obtained a Lets Encrypt certificate as above then go to <b>About</b> on the administrator control panel and you should see your HTMLy blog domain listed there along with an onion address. You can then navigate to your site in a browser.
      </p>

      <p>
	To see the login password for your site go to <b>Passwords</b> on the <b>Administrator control panel</b> and select the appropriate username and app. The passwords will be different for each user and may not be the same as the password which you used to originally ssh into the system.
      </p>

      <p>
	Navigate to <a href="https://yourhtmlyblogdomain/login">https://yourhtmlyblogdomain/login</a> and enter your username and password. You can then create posts or edit existing ones.
