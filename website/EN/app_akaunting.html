	The LibreServer system isn't primarily aimed at companies or institutions, but if you're a one person company or freelancer then having the ability to run your own accounting system and keep the data private and also backed up is useful. Akaunting provides a nice web based system for small business accounts, and is also quite usable within a mobile web browser.
      </p>

      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <p>
	Log into your system with:
      </p>

      <pre>ssh myusername@mydomain -p 2222</pre>

      <p>
	Using cursor keys and Enter key select <b>Administrator controls</b> and type in your password.
      </p>

      <p>
	Select <b>Add/Remove Apps</b> then <b>akaunting</b>. Enter the subdomain that you which to use, such as <b>accounts.mydomain.net</b>, and optionally a FreeDNS code.
      </p>

      <p>
	From the <b>Administrator control panel</b> select <b>Passwords</b> and look up the password for <b>mariadb</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Now in a browser navigate to your subdomain. You will need to enter some details for the database. The password should be the mariadb one.
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>
	After that you'll need to enter a company name and an email address. You can make the administrator password anything you prefer, and a suggestion can be found within the <b>Passwords</b> section of the <b>Administrator control panel</b> under <b>akaunting</b>.
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>
	From then on the system should be usable. Accounts software can often be quite complex, and so you'll probably want to refer to the <a href="https://akaunting.com/docs">official documentation</a> for details.
