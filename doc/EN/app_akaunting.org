* Akaunting

The LibreServer system isn't primarily aimed at companies or institutions, but if you're a one person company or freelancer then having the ability to run your own accounting system and keep the data private and also backed up is useful. Akaunting provides a nice web based system for small business accounts, and is also quite usable within a mobile web browser.

* Installation
Log into your system with:

#+begin_src bash
ssh myusername@mydomain -p 2222
#+end_src

Using cursor keys and Enter key select *Administrator controls* and type in your password.

Select *Add/Remove Apps* then *akaunting*. Enter the subdomain that you which to use, such as *accounts.mydomain.net*, and optionally a FreeDNS code.

From the *Administrator control panel* select *Passwords* and look up the password for *mariadb*.

Now in a browser navigate to your subdomain. You will need to enter some details for the database. The password should be the mariadb one.

After that you'll need to enter a company name and an email address. You can make the administrator password anything you prefer, and a suggestion can be found within the *Passwords* section of the *Administrator control panel* under *akaunting*.

From then on the system should be usable. Accounts software can often be quite complex, and so you'll probably want to refer to the [[https://akaunting.com/docs][official documentation]] for details.
