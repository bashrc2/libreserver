* Lychee

Lychee is a simple and lightweight photo album for the web. Whether you're an amateur or professional photographer, or want to publish random holiday pics or cat pictures. Lychee just does what it says it does without any fuss. There is also a photo album feature within [[./app_hubzilla.html][Hubzilla]] if you need more sophisticated social photo sharing with individualised permissions.

* Installation
Log into your system with:

#+begin_src bash
ssh myusername@mydomain -p 2222
#+end_src

Using cursor keys and Enter key select *Administrator controls* and type in your password.

Select *Add/Remove Apps* then *lychee*. You will then be asked for a domain name and if you are using FreeDNS also the code for the domain which can be found under *Dynamic DNS* on the FreeDNS site (the random string from "/quick cron example/" which appears after /update.php?/ and before />>/). For more details on obtaining a domain and making it accessible via dynamic DNS see the [[./faq.html][FAQ]]. Typically the domain name you use will be a subdomain, such as /code.mydomainname.net/. It will need to be a domain which you have bought somewhere and own and not one of the FreeDNS subdomains, otherwise you won't be able to get a SSL/TLS certificate for it.

After the install has completed go to *Security settings* and select *Create a new Let's Encrypt certificate* and enter the domain name that you are using for Lychee. If you're using the "onion only" version of the system then you don't need to do this. If the certificate is obtained successfully then you will see a congratulations message.

* Initial setup
If you have just obtained a Lets Encrypt certificate as above then go to *About* on the administrator control panel and you should see your Lychee domain listed there along with an onion address. You can then navigate to your site in a browser.

Within a browser navigate to your lychee domain name or onion address. It should look like this:

Within the *Administrator control panel* select *App Settings* and then *lychee*. This will show the initial login settings which you need to set up the database. To copy the password hold down the shift key, select the password then right click and copy.

After that create a username and password and store them in your favourite password manager. And you're done. Add photos and albums as you wish.
