* Bludit

This is a databaseless blogging system which uses markdown files. It's not very complex and so there is not much to go wrong, and it should run well on any server hardware.

* Installation
Log into your system with:

#+begin_src bash
ssh myusername@mydomain -p 2222
#+end_src

Using cursor keys and Enter key select *Administrator controls* and type in your password.

Select *Add/Remove Apps* then *bluit*. Enter the subdomain that you which to use, such as *blog.mydomain*, and optionally a FreeDNS code.

Now in a browser navigate to your subdomain. You will need to enter some details for the database. You'll be asked to provide an initial administrator password.

From there on it's all pretty straightforward. If you need to publish a draft the post status can be changed on a drop down list on the right hand side.

If you need to subsequently get to the administrator controls to create a new blog navigate to *blog.mydomain/admin* and log in.
